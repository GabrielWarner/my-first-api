# Family API



## Description
In this mini project I created a server and API to help me further understand how to use express JS along with heroku. In this mini project I setup a server using express JS, I initialized my files and created a db JSON file to hold family members as my test data. I created a simple get request to send back and html file, I then created a post request that will input an entry into the database. In the HTML file I setup two input fields and a submit button to submit entrys to the database.
